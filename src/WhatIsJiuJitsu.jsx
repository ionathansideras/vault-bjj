            <p>
                Jiu Jitsu is a martial art which focuses on grappling, with
                ground fighting being a major component of the style. We use
                body weight, gravity and momentum to defend ourselves even when
                physically outmatched. Proper technique is key and learning from
                experienced teachers is essential to progress. With training,
                students not only learn to defend themselves in the real world,
                but also gain physical fitness, confidence and mental
                concentration skills as well.
